//Fruits into Baskets (Medium)
//Given an array of characters where each character represents a fruit tree.
// you are given two baskets and your goal is to put maximum number of fruits in each basket.
// The only restriction is that each basket can have only one type of fruit.
//
//You can start with any tree, but once you have started you canâ€™t skip a tree.
// You will pick one fruit from each tree until you cannot, i.e., you will stop when you have to pick from a third fruit type.
//
//Write a function to return the maximum number of fruits in both the baskets.
//
//Example 1:
//
//Input: Fruit=['A', 'B', 'C', 'A', 'C']
//Output: 3
//Explanation: We can put 2 'C' in one basket and one 'A' in the other from the subarray ['C', 'A', 'C']
//Example 2:
//
//Input: Fruit=['A', 'B', 'C', 'B', 'B', 'C']
//Output: 5
//Explanation: We can put 3 'B' in one basket and two 'C' in the other basket.
//This can be done if we start with the second letter: ['B', 'C', 'B', 'B', 'C']
